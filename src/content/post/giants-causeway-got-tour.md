Come along and explore the enchanting coastal beauty, starting with the historic Dunluce Castle ruins (16th century). Once inhabited by both the McQuillan and Mac Donnell Clans, the castle is also renowned as the filming location for the "Game of Thrones" House of GreyJoy, Pyke Castle.

## GIANTS CAUSEWAY

Next, venture to the awe-inspiring Giants Causeway, featuring around 40,000 large, regularly shaped polygonal columns of basalt in perfect horizontal sections. This natural wonder is famous for the legend of Finn Mac Cool, who created the Causeway to reach Scotland and challenge his Scottish Giants rival, Banadonner.

## BALLINTOY HARBOUR

Continue the journey to Ballintoy Harbour, known as the town of the North. In the 19th century, the harbor served primarily for shipping stones, with a small rail track transporting stones and limestone to the quayside. This picturesque harbor was also featured in "Game of Thrones" as Theon Greyjoy's arrival point in the Iron Islands and the location where he admires his ship, the Sea Bitch.
